# C++ Programming: Basics

## What is C++?
C++ is an extension of C that adds object-oriented features. It is widely used for software infrastructure, games, and performance-critical applications.

## Hello, World! in C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Concepts
- **Statements** end with a semicolon.
- **Functions** are blocks of code that perform tasks.
- **main()** is the entry point of every C++ program.
- **std::cout** is used for output.

## Compiling and Running
1. Save your code in a file, e.g., `hello.cpp`.
2. Compile: `g++ hello.cpp -o hello`
3. Run: `./hello`

## Practice
- Change the message in `std::cout`.
- Add another output line.
