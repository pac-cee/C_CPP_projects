# C Programming: Basics

## What is C?
C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s. It is widely used for system/software development and embedded programming.

## Hello, World! in C
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Concepts
- **Statements** end with a semicolon.
- **Functions** are blocks of code that perform tasks.
- **main()** is the entry point of every C program.
- **printf** is used for output.

## Compiling and Running
1. Save your code in a file, e.g., `hello.c`.
2. Compile: `gcc hello.c -o hello`
3. Run: `./hello`

## Practice
- Change the message in `printf`.
- Add another `printf` line.
